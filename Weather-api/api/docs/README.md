## Background
- Grubhub’s Partner Integration API enables a merchant’s Point-of-sale, third-party online-ordering provider, or the merchant themselves to seamlessly manage menus and Grubhub orders within their existing operational workflows. 
- The end results of an effective integration include increased operational efficiency for the merchant and improved service levels to customers. 
- Integration functionality includes:
   - Menu creation, ingestion, and updates
   - Order handling and status
   - Delivery information
   - Stockouts
   - Tags & Taxes

## Grubhub API

### Authentication
- Grubhub utilises two different authentication schemes for authenticating requests from Qu to Grubhub and Grubhub to Qu.
- For calls from Qu to Grubhub, the request must contain two specific header with the required parameters.
- For calls from Grubhub to Qu webhooks, Qu expects a valid JWT in the authorization header.

## Process Orders
### Flow:
- The order injection flow allows for retrieving and managing orders placed for a given location.
- New orders are identified by filtering for the `RESTAURANT_CONFIRMABLE` status.
- Future orders are identified by filtering for the `ANTICIPATED` status.
- We are not handling future orders, as we get second notification when order is `RESTAURANT_CONFIRMABLE`.
- We are ignoring test orders based on `is_test` property.
